# Better SQL Extension Pack

VSCode is has no SQL support by default.
To fix this, I made this extension pack that add SQL superpower to VSCode.

## List of extensions built-in

- mtxr.sqltools
- mtxr.sqltools-driver-mssql
- mtxr.sqltools-driver-mysql
- mtxr.sqltools-driver-pg
- mtxr.sqltools-driver-sqlite

**Enjoy!**
